This tool consumes recipes formatted in a straightforward text-based format
and produces an epub document that can be loaded onto an e-reader for
reference during cooking.

I've only tested it on the Barnes and Noble Nook, but it ought to work on
any e-reader that can handle basic XHTML and CSS. It is especially likely
to work on e-readers based on Adobe Digital Editions.

An example of the directory structure and file format provided is in this
repository:

Note that the templates used by this program hard-code a particular book
title, author and guid. If you want to use this for something else you
should probably change that.
